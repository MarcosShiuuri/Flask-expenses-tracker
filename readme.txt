Python web app for keeping track of expenses using Flask

This app allows the user to add new expenses with information like name, type of payment, the local and value.

Since the goal of this project was to improve my knowledge fo the backend, the frontend uses basic HTML and CSS.

MADE USING:
    Python - v3.11.0
    Flask - v2.2.2
    HTML5 & CSS
